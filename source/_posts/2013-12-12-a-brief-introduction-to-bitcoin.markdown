You've probably heard of Bitcoin(if you haven't you probably aren't going to find this post) and you probably understand that it's some new currency that everyone seems to be making a big fuss about. I'm not here to tell you to go out and buy Bitcoin or that it's a "bubble" on the verge of collapsing, but instead to give you a little insight on where Bitcoin came from and how it works. I don't know if Bitcoin is going to succeed, although a lot of wealthy, powerful people are backing it, but I do think it deservers a fair chance and the only way that's going to happen is if people are exposed to it and understand it.

First off, watch this video put together by [Duncan Elms](http://duncanelms.com){: target="_blank"} and [Marc Fennel](http://marcfennell.com){: target="_blank"}:

### Origin
Bitcoin was introduced in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. The real identity of Satoshi is actually unknown, and although many people have investigated, all have been unsuccessful in determining who this guy really is. Satoshi's anonymity should not undermine the validity or stability of Bitcoin and rather is a non-issue due the open-source nature of the Bitcoin software.

### How It Works
The Bitcoin network works very similar to they way email works. Each Bitcoin 'wallet' has an address and you can initiate a transaction as long as you know the address you want to send the Bitcoins to. Compare it to [Square's Cash](https://square.com/cash) platform which allows you to email funds directly to anyone as long as you know their email address. Behind the scenes is the 'block chain'. Bitcoin's block chain is a public ledger that displays every transaction ever made. Hence the big news story last month covering a [$147 milion Bitcoin Transaction](http://www.fastcompany.com/3022159/fast-feed/someone-just-made-147-million-bitcoin-transaction). Part of the reason that story took off was the lack of info regarding both parties in the transaction. Although the block chain shows both Bitcoin addresses, it doesn't provide user/personal information about the actual owners of those Bitcoin wallets. 

### Anonymity
Bitcoin was popularized in part by [The Silk Road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)) and other Tor sites due to the seemingly anonymous nature. It's important to know that it isn't truly anonymous, but rather it's much easier to cover your tracks with Bitcoin than with another payment platform. However, in the past couple of years exchanges have started to collect personal data from their users due to anti-money laundering laws in the US and various other regulations. 

### Mining, huh?
There is a finite limit to the number of Bitcoins allowed to enter the marketplace: 21 million. In November we hit 12 million, and with every Bitcoin mined, the process slows accordingly. The process of introducing Bitcoins into circulation is dubbed 'mining' because of it's resemblance to the mining of other precious metals (i.e. gold). The actual mining process is the computation of a complex cryptographic math problem guess-and-check style. As more miners join the race, the difficulty of creating each block rises to counter the increased number of miners, keeping the average time between block creation at 10 minutes. As of now the reward for creating a block is 25 Bitcoins, but this value decreases with time as well (it's halved every 210,000 blocks). Early on, people were able to mine Bitcoins from their desktop computers. Then as the computations became more intense, the mining software began to consume more and more power to produce the same output. It's no longer realistic for everyday people to mine Bitcoin simply because the electricity costs for running the hardware would be greater than the reward. To put this in perspective, [an article on Forbes estimated daily electricity costs purely for Bitcoin mining at $15 million](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/12/03/fascinating-number-bitcoin-mining-uses-15-millions-worth-of-electricity-every-day/). 

### How do I buy them?
Part of the problem with Bitcoin at this time, is it's not readily accessible to the general public. Considering the environment in which Bitcoin took root(the mailing list for a cryptography advocates group known as cypherpunks), I think the amount of exposure Bitcoin has gotten thus far is pretty impressive. The easiest way to obtain Bitcoins is to open an account at an online exchange. These exchanges work similar to other currency exchanges and also the buying/selling of stocks. Some of the more popular exchanges at this time are [Mt Gox](https://www.mtgox.com/)(based in Japan, and widely considered to be the largest and most popular), [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/)(a European based exchange) and [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/)(a Bay Area startup who happened to [raise $25 million in additional funding today](http://blog.coinbase.com/post/69775463031/coinbase-raises-25-million-from-andreessen-horowitz)). 

### Should I invest?
I don't know! Many speculators claim it's the largest "bubble" yet or [the world's greatest private ponzi scheme to date](http://www.garynorth.com/public/11828.cfm), while many venture capitalists are pouring money into Bitcoin-based startups such as Coinbase. One key difference between Bitcoin and other currencies, is that each transaction takes about 10 minutes to complete. This is due to the built-in algorithm and was specifically chosen to prevent defraud attempts. That shouldn't be a barrier to trading in general or specifically arbitrage; it just means you should have enough funds to support multiple transactions at once in order to capitalize on the quick price changes.
