description: Why its important to have a red team in the software development industry
---

A couple of weeks ago, an episode of HBO's _The Newsroom_ brought to light the concept and importance of having a 'red team'. The red team, as described in the show, is a select group of team members who are intentionally left in the dark while a story is flushed out. Once enough 'proof' has been established by the reporters chasing the story, they would then run it by the red team to see if the fresh eyes can poke any holes in it.

The concept certainly isn't new and you probably use it already, but perhaps not as often as you should. Its especially valuable to have a fresh perspective on a website you've been heads-down on for the past month before releasing for the client. It's not uncommon for the seemingly miniscule assumptions you started the project with, to grow into some pretty large and unpredicted changes by the end, so it's important to make sure the team made the right decisions along the way. The best way to do this is to show a team member the dev site and see if they can identify how all of the requirements have been met.

Any process where someone's work is reviewed by another team member is similar to a red team scenario, but there's one major difference: the reviewer is oftentimes not looking for reasons the work is poor, but rather reasons said work is good or OK. With this comes differing levels of scrutiny, and resultantly not all of the same problems will be identified by the more positive reviewer as those identified by the more negative reviewer. Use your best judgement to determine if a scenario requires the use of a red team, but most situations where the main team has any doubt or made several assumptions are generally good candidates and will see the most benefit.
