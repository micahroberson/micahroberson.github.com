I love to make things. More specifically, I love to make things I don't know how to make, which also happen to be things that I need or could use to improve my work, life, etc.

I recently left my full-time job to pursue a startup of my own, <a href='http://www.readyappsdevelopment.com'>ReadyApps</a>, and in doing so I have been prompted to learn much, much more than I did at my last position. Which is great. Its awesome actually. I look at a project not only as an opportunity to build a great tool for the client, but also as a means to becoming a better programmer with more exposure to different technologies. 

Our most recent project, is a Project Management toolsuite designed for a mirror manufacturer/distributor down in LA. These guys essentially needed an ERP solution, but didn't want it to be nearly as complicated as most ERP solutions are. So we sat down with several of the employees for a few days, so we could map out their process and really understand the requirements. We discovered their process isn't all that unique, in fact, its awfully similar to ours. This is great for two main reasons. 1. We actually have a good perspective which will help with designing the application for the client. 2. Which is the result of the first - we can actually use the end product we're building. Come the end of this project, we'll have a project management tool which we can use in house for managing all of our future projects, and we're also in a unique position to open it up as a SASS based tool. 

In the coming weeks, I'll discuss the overall architecture and some of the hurdles we've overcome thus far.
